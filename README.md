**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**:

The **Auto Sales Analysis** project is a comprehensive data analytics and visualization aimed at understanding vehicle sales performance across different dimensions such as time, geography, vehicle type, dealer performance and customer preferences. By leveraging Microsoft Power Bi, this project transforms raw sales data into interactive and insightful dashboard that enables business stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions.

**TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED**:

  * **Power Bi Desktop**: The primary tool used to build the dashboard. It allowed importing, cleaning, modelling and visualizing data in an user-friendly and interactive manner.
  * **Power Query**: Used for **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process. With Power Query raw datasets were cleaned, null values handled, column names standardized, and unnecessary fields removed.
  * **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Applied for creating calculated columns, measures, and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Sales, Year-over-Year growth, Average sales per Dealer, and Profit Margin.

**METHODOLOGY AND WORKFLOW**:

The workflow of this project can be broken down into the following stages:

  1. **Data import and Preparation**:

     Raw auto sales data was imported into Power Bi. The dataset contained fields such as sales transaction Id, dealer name, vehicle model, category, sales amount, units sold, date of sale and location. Using Power Query, the dataset was cleaned: duplicate rows were removed, missing values addressed and derived columns were created for time-based analysis.
